Made by MRCAT9898 <3

## About the plugin:
This plugin add's all the function that needs to RPF use.

## Why LabAPI and not Exiled?
Because LabAPI use less memory and is more efficient for the server.
(The main plugin will always be in exiled <3 )

## How I add This? 
This plugin **NEED** to be added **ONLY** in the LabAPI plugin folder
**NOT** in Exiled-

## Where I put My schematic file?
The plugin build a directory in the path of the config so YOU need to place it where 
you want it. (very preferable in the config of LabAPI folder)
